# AHB2APB_bridge
This project aims to design and verify an AHB to APB bridge with a single master and single slave connected through an asynchronous FIFO buffer. This bridge will facilitate communication between a high-performance AHB bus and a low-power APB bus, bridging the performance and power consumption gap between them.
